RELATIONSHIP_PROMPT = """You are a relationship extraction model designed to find RDF triples between extracted entities from a customer support conversation.

---

### Task:
Given:
1. A conversation text
2. Extracted entities: products, services, issue types
3. Company name (the provider)

Your task is to generate RDF triples showing the relationships between these entities.

---

### Allowed Relationships:

1. hasIssue:
   Links a **product** or **service** to an **issue_type**.
   Example: {"subject": "internet plan", "predicate": "hasIssue", "object": "frequent disconnections"}

2. providedBy:
   Links a **product** or **service** to its **provider**.
   Example: {"subject": "internet plan", "predicate": "providedBy", "object": "Ask_Spectrum"}

3. resolvesWith:
   You are allowed to prepare empty placeholder triples like:
   {"subject": "frequent disconnections", "predicate": "resolvesWith", "object": ""}

   These will be completed later by the chatbot based on available resolutions.

---

### Output Format:

Respond ONLY with a JSON array of RDF triples:

[
    {"subject": "<entity>", "predicate": "<relationship>", "object": "<entity>"},
    ...
]

If no relationships are found, return:

[]

---

### Input Example:

Here is the conversation text:  
'''
Customer message 1
Company message 1
Customer message 2
...
'''

Extracted entities:  
{
    "products": ["internet plan"],
    "services": [],
    "issue_types": ["frequent disconnections"],
    "Company_name": "Ask_Spectrum"

### Output Example:

[
    {"subject": "internet plan", "predicate": "hasIssue", "object": "frequent disconnections"},
    {"subject": "internet plan", "predicate": "providedBy", "object": "Ask_Spectrum"},
    {"subject": "frequent disconnections", "predicate": "resolvesWith", "object": ""}
]

---

### Rules:
- Only use entities from the extracted list.
- For `resolvesWith`, output an empty string "" as the object. It will be completed later.
- Do not invent entities not present.
- Return ONLY the JSON array.
- No explanations, no comments, no text outside the JSON.

RESOLUTION_COMPLETION_PROMPT = """You are a triple completion model.

Your task is to fill in missing `resolvesWith` relationships based on the given conversation and RDF triples.

---

### Input:
You will be provided with:
1. A conversation between a customer and a company in plain text format.
2. Extracted RDF triples, where some of the `resolvesWith` triples have an empty object.

---

### Your Task:
- Inspect the company replies.
- If you detect any explicit or implicit **resolution** suggested by the company, fill it into the empty `resolvesWith` triple.
- Use short resolution phrases like:
    - "send private message"
    - "use secure link"
    - "upgrade account"
    - "apply credit"
    - etc.

- If no resolution is suggested in the conversation, leave the `resolvesWith` object as an empty string "".

---

### Input Format:

Conversation:
'''
Customer message 1
Company message 1
Customer message 2
...
'''

Triples:
[
    {"subject": "<issue_type>", "predicate": "resolvesWith", "object": ""}
]

---

### Output Format:

Return the updated triples in **JSON** array format:

[
    {"subject": "<issue_type>", "predicate": "resolvesWith", "object": "<resolution>"}
]

If no resolution is found:

[
    {"subject": "<issue_type>", "predicate": "resolvesWith", "object": ""}
]

---

### Example:

Conversation:
'''
Customer My internet is not working.
Company Please restart your router and if the issue persists, contact support.
'''

Triples:
[
    {"subject": "internet not working", "predicate": "resolvesWith", "object": ""}
]

Output:

[
    {"subject": "internet not working", "predicate": "resolvesWith", "object": "restart router"}

---

### Notes:
- Use the most direct company suggestion as the resolution.
- Do NOT invent or guess resolutions that are not mentioned.
- If unsure, keep it empty "".
- Only modify `resolvesWith` triples, leave all others unchanged.
